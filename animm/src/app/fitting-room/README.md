# Virtual Fitting Room - AI-Powered Clothing Recognition

This implementation provides real-time clothing recognition and analysis using TensorFlow.js directly in the browser. No backend processing required!

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Continuous analysis of camera feed using COCO-SSD model
- **Live Detection Mode**: Toggle between real-time and single-capture modes
- **Advanced Color Analysis**: Analyzes dominant colors, saturation, brightness, and temperature
- **Shape & Fit Analysis**: Determines clothing shape, characteristics, and proportions
- **Material Detection**: Simulates material recognition based on visual characteristics
- **Style Recommendations**: Provides AI-generated style suggestions
- **Camera Integration**: Seamless webcam access with error handling
- **Visual Indicators**: Live detection status and real-time feedback

## Technology Stack

- **TensorFlow.js**: For object detection and machine learning
- **COCO-SSD**: Pre-trained model for object detection
- **Canvas API**: For image processing and color analysis
- **React**: Component-based UI
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better development experience

## Architecture

```

## How It Works

1. **Model Loading**: TensorFlow.js loads the COCO-SSD model on initialization
2. **Camera Access**: Uses `getUserMedia` API to access webcam
3. **Object Detection**: Captured frames are processed through COCO-SSD model
4. **Enhanced Analysis**:
   - Color analysis using Canvas API pixel sampling
   - Shape analysis based on bounding box proportions
   - Material detection using color characteristics
5. **Results Display**: Real-time visualization of detected items and analysis

## Installation

The required dependencies are already added to `package.json`:

```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/coco-ssd
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to `/fitting-room` in your application
2. Camera and detection start automatically when the page loads
3. Position yourself in front of the camera wearing clothing you want to analyze
4. Analysis updates automatically when new clothing is detected
5. View simplified analysis showing clothing type and dominant color

## Customization

### Adding New Clothing Types

To detect specific clothing types, you can:

1. **Train a Custom Model**: Use TensorFlow.js to train on your specific dataset
2. **Extend Detection Logic**: Modify the `DetectionService` to handle additional object classes
3. **Enhance Analysis**: Add more sophisticated color and shape analysis algorithms

### Improving Accuracy

- **Higher Resolution**: Increase camera resolution for better detection
- **Better Lighting**: Ensure good lighting conditions
- **Multiple Angles**: Capture from different angles for better analysis
- **Custom Training**: Train models on your specific clothing datasets

## Performance Considerations

- **Model Size**: COCO-SSD is ~27MB, loads once on initialization
- **Processing Time**: Detection takes ~200-500ms depending on device
- **Memory Usage**: Canvas operations are memory-intensive for large images
- **Browser Support**: Requires modern browsers with WebGL support

## Limitations

- **COCO-SSD Classes**: Limited to 80 object classes, not all clothing-specific
- **Color Analysis**: Simplified algorithm, may not be 100% accurate
- **Shape Detection**: Basic analysis based on bounding box proportions
- **Material Detection**: Simulated based on color characteristics

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Clothing Model**: Train specialized model for clothing detection
2. **Advanced Color Analysis**: Implement more sophisticated color algorithms
3. **3D Shape Analysis**: Add depth perception for better shape analysis
4. **Real-time Processing**: Continuous detection without manual capture
5. **AR Integration**: Overlay analysis results on live camera feed

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working

- Check browser permissions
- Ensure HTTPS (required for camera access)
- Try different browsers

### Model Loading Issues

- Check internet connection (model downloads from CDN)
- Clear browser cache
- Check console for error messages

### Poor Detection Accuracy

- Improve lighting conditions
- Ensure good camera positioning
- Try different clothing items
- Check if objects are within detection confidence threshold
